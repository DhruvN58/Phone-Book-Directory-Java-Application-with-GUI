# Phone Directory - Basic Data Structures Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Phone Directory project! As contacts increase, organizing them becomes essential for easy access. This Java application leverages basic data structures to create a phone book system that allows you to add, delete, edit, and sort contact information. When you add a contact, you can provide personal details such as first name, surname, last name, phone number, and address. The application lets you view, edit, delete, and sort contacts as per your needs.

## Features

- Search for a contact by name or phone number.
